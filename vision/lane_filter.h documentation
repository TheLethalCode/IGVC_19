void visualization(double **matrix,int n,int m):

It uses opencv to visualize a matrix.It subtracts the minimum value of all elements from the matrix and normalizes them between 0 to 255 and displays the image.
n is the number of rows and m is the number of colums and matrix is the matrix to be visualized.

void print_matrix(double **matrix,int rows,int cols):

prints a 2d matrix

double **getTemplate(double sigma,double theta,int rows,int cols,double multiplier2=1,double multiplier1=1):

returns a 2d kernal of the mexican hat(negative of double derivative of gaussian)
sigma is the variance of the gaussian
theta is the angle by with the gaussian has to be rotated
rows and cols are the dimensions of the kernel
multiplier2 multiplies the negative values of the kernal
multiplier1 multiplies the positive values of the kernal

Mat apply_kernel(Mat img,double **matrix,int rows,int cols,int threshold2=0,int threshold3=255):

img is image on which the kernal is applied
matrix is the kernel to be applied
rows and cols are the dimensions of the matrix
thereshold2 is the value below which the value of the pixel is set to 0
thereshold3 is the value above which the value of the pixel is set to 255
